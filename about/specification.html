<p><b>Penalty for Late Submission</b><br>
If you submit your coursework late but within 24 hours or one working day of the specified deadline, 10 marks will be deducted from the final mark, as a penalty for late submission, 
except for work which obtains a mark in the range 40 - 49%, in which case the mark will be capped at the pass mark (40%). 
If you submit your coursework more than 24 hours or more than one working day after the specified deadline you will be given a mark of zero for the work in question unless a claim of Mitigating Circumstances has been submitted and accepted as valid. 

</p>
<p>It is recognised that on occasion, illness or a personal crisis can mean that you fail to submit a piece of work on time. In such cases you must inform the Campus Office in writing on a mitigating circumstances form, giving the reason for your late or non-submission. You must provide relevant documentary evidence with the form. This information will be reported to the relevant Assessment Board that will decide whether the mark of zero shall stand. For more detailed information regarding University Assessment Regulations, please refer to the following website: http://www.westminster.ac.uk/study/current-students/resources/academic-regulations

</p><p>If you are unable to submit your work due to a finance hold you must email your work to FSTRegistry@westminster.ac.uk by the same deadline, putting on the subject line the module code, assessment number, and your name. This shows that you have completed your work by the deadline. After the finance hold is lifted you must then submit the same work as normal on Blackboard, otherwise it will not be marked and you will get a fail for that assessment.
</p><p>
</p>
<p><b>To submit your assignment:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Log on to Blackboard at http://learning.westminster.ac.uk; </li>
<li>Go to the relevant module Blackboard site; </li>
<li>Click on the Coursework submission link on the left-hand side as advised by the module leader; </li>
<li>Click on the link to the relevant assignment;</li>
<li>Follow the 'upload' and 'submit' instructions.</li>
</ul>

  <b>Specification:</b> 
  Work in groups of 4 students (all group members should be from the  same Web Design and Development tutorial group). Prepare a Web site about a subject of 
  your choice (please see at the bottom of the page for a list of possible
  subjects). 
  You have to ensure that your site complies with the Janet
  regulations on publications of web pages (see under Blackboard link to Assessment Details).
  This Web site should include:<p></p>

<ol>
<li>(Student 1) A presentation page with title and the name of everyone in the group.  After 4 seconds, a second page will be displayed (Main Web page). 
</li>
<li> (Student 2) Your Main page should be designed so that the user can access several parts of the site.  The links on your main page should look like buttons and have a hover effect. This should be created using CSS. 
</li>
<li>(Student 1) Use JavaScript to create the functionality to increase / decrease 
the font size used on the website. The basic functionality should include two buttons - a button to make the font size smaller and a button
to make the font size larger (half allocated marks). Advanced functionality will allow for the font size to increase in steps up and down (full allocated marks).</li>
<li>(Student 2) Your site should contain a form to send comments about your web site.
This form should include:
<ul>
<li> input fields for users to enter their details (name, email address)
</li><li> a field to enter comments
</li><li> a way to rate your web site (using radio buttons or select)
</li><li> Use JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the compulsory fields - 'name' and 'rating'.
Do NOT use HTML5 validation for this part.</li>
<li>If the name and ratings are filled-in, the user should get an HTML popup window with the summary including the name, any comments and rating given on the form. <br> 
<u>For example</u>, if the user entered "John" for their name, rated the site as "good" and entered "Very informative website", the popup window should say something like: "Dear John, Thank you very much for your feedback. You have rated our site as <b>Good</b> and your comment was <b>Very informative website</b>."
</li></ul>
</li><li>(Student 1) Your site should contain a form to allow people to buy products related to the topic of 
your web site, i.e. if your topic is football, you could be selling 
football shirts, accessories, etc. This should include:
<ul>
<li>personal details</li>
<li>at least 3 different products to choose from</li>
<li>number of items for each product</li>
<li>automatically provide the total price of the bill. </li>
<li>Use JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the following compulsory fields - personal details, product 
and number of items.  Do NOT use HTML5 validation for this part.
</li>
<li>If the compulsory fields are filled-in, when the 'place order' button is clicked, the user should get 
a popup window with the summary of the order. <u>For example</u>, 
the text in the popup window could be something like: "Dear John, you have ordered 2 T-shirts size M at a 
cost of £20 each and a pair of trainers at a cost of £50. Your total bill is £90."</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>  (Student 4) Your site should contain a sitemap.  The sitemap should have navigation links to the appropriate part of the group website.  
Additionally, in your individual report you should include a diagram of the information architecture of the group website and  discuss the structure used.</li>
<li>(Student 3) Your site should contain an interactive multiple choice 
quiz about the subject you are developing on your Web site. Once the 
quiz has been completed, it gives the user a mark on how he/she 
performed. This should be time limited.  When the quiz is finished should also 
display the summary of the user performance (which answers were correct or incorrect, and how long it took to complete the quiz). The user will 
get 2 marks for each correct answer, and -1 for each wrong answer. The 
quiz should consist of 10 questions. The background colour of the page 
should change according to the awarded mark. 
</li><li>
(Student 4) Create a page that allows the user to view images.  This page contains a form, 5 thumbnail images, and 2 pull-down menus (to select 
the page background colour and the page text colour) and an area to display a larger image and associated description of that image.  
When the user selects a thumbnail image, the corresponding large image and the description of that image should 
display in the defined location on the form.  You may use onMouseOver or radio buttons to select the thumbnail.
<br>
</li><li> (Student 3)  Your main page should contain four pictures of the members of the group. 
  When the user moves the mouse over one picture, the details of that member should be displayed in an area on the page (for example, you could use a div below the pictures). 
  The details should include the name and role that that student took for the coursework (e.g. John Smith, Student 1). </li>

  
  <li>      Consistency of style should be ensured using
<ol type="a">
<li> a unique external style sheet file main page and navigation(Student 2) 
</li><li> used throughout the web site (all students) 
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>(All students) Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group. </li>
<ul>
  <li>This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to a potential employer.  Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion does not need to follow the design of the main website.</li>
</ul>


<li>  (All students)     Any page longer than the screen size should have links to various parts of the text at the top of the page. 
</li>

<li> (All students)     Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a
  link to the page editor (the person who wrote the page) at the bottom 
  of the page.   (E.g., here you could make a link to the CV of the person who created that page). </li>
  
  
<li>(All students) Each student should create one 'information page' relating to the website topic and use this web page to demonstrate  
how you have addressed the following design issues (these issues will be discussed in your report):</li>

<ul>
<li>accessibility;</li>
<li>typography;</li>
<li>colour (contrast);</li>
<li>colour (balance / combination);</li>
<li>Gestalt principles for grouping.</li>
</ul>

<li> (All students) Feel free to use additional JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of navigation. 
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Demonstration</b><br>
You will have to give a compulsory live demo of your Web site in your tutorial class (see schedule). 
</p>
<p><b>Report</b><br>
Each student should submit an <strong>individual</strong> report to Blackboard by <b>10 AM 21 March 2017</b>. Show your group name on your report. The report should include:
 </p><ul>
 <li><b>Main body of report</b></li>
<ul>
